This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript involving implicit type coercion. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers but does not explicitly check for type errors.  When it receives a number and a string, the compiler does not throw an error and instead implicitly coerces the number to a string before performing concatenation. This can be difficult to spot without careful review.
